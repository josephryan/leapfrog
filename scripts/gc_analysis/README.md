# Project Title

frog_individ_gc.pl - a script used to calculate GC content and average 
     length of G/C stretches. Used to compare hidden orthologs (output
     of leapfrog program) to whole transcriptomes.

### Prerequisities

you need the transcriptomes used in the leapfrog paper

## Getting Started

The standard usage of the program is:
<pre>./frog_individ_gc.pl FROGFILE FASTAFILE NAME</pre>
where FROGFILE=output of leapfrog, FASTAFILE=transcriptome input to leapfrog, and NAME=a name applied to output files

* script.frog_individ_gc
After downloading the transcriptomes and either moved, copied, or
linked them in the FASTA folder, the script 'script.frog_individ_gc' can be
used to launch all the analyses.
